                    If you are participating in a record of interview with police you may make a comment or no comment interview. It is important to remember that whatever
                    you say during a record of interview may be used by the prosecution to prove their case in court. For

                    The law in relation to driving offences is complex and the Courts have a very wide discretion to suspend your licence or disqualify you from obtaining one for a period of time. If you are worried about losing your licence call our office on 1800 633 625 to speak with one of our expert traffic lawyers. Our lawyers will advise you as to the likelihood that you will lose your licence, other penalties that may apply, and what you should do in order to achieve the best outcome in your matter.

                    If you have been found guilty of an offence, or plead guilty but feel the sentence received was excessive, you may appeal the decision to a higher court.
                    If your matter was heard in the Magistrates Court your appeal will be heard in the County Court. You do not need the Courts permission to lodge an appeal as long as you file the necessary paperwork within 28 days of the decision.

                    Eligibility is assessed on a case by case basis and can be discussed further with you at your first appointment.
                    Victorian Legal Aid has recently tightened the eligibility requirements for funding in criminal law matters. Although eligibility is determined on a case by case basis you will usually need to be receiving a Centrelink benefit and be facing a term of imprisonment if found guilty of the offence charged.
